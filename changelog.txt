2016-08-31 ** 0.5.0
* Flux-ISH data flow in example app
Data is fetched, processed and updated at the App implementation level
(@@DASHBOARD LEVEL?). 
Only Dashboard level actions can change state.
Dashboard uses component settings from settings.js and dataHandlers (read:
reducers) to calculate component data. 
All components are passed static data at render.
For a component to update data / application state it must trigger an action
at the dashboard / app level

* Regions
Regions will render rows, allowing for easy responsive grid rendering.

* Multi Regions
Regions can now be define 'multi: true' in props, in which case the named
dataHandler will be called. The data handler should return a string which will
serve as a key, this key is used to select which sub-region to render from the
multi-region. Replaces Multi Component.

* data abstraction - dataKeys
We add an abstraction for dataKeys - a dataKey represents an individual
app-level data source, which contains query objects

* Filters
We have a common filter settings definition that includes the field to filter
and a willFilter array to determine which dataKey's data we are filtering...
see full documentation @@LINK 
Added BaseFilter component 
Move event handling to base class to unify filter implementations
Add example of app filtering in example app

* Added Checkbox Filter
A simple checkbox input inherits from BaseFilter component

* Removed Multi Component
See Multi Regions above

* Add datahandlers to common library:
getXYBYQueryDataWhere
whiteListValues
inspect


& update datahandlers:
common.getXYBYQueryData - add dashboardData.dataKey level of data abstraction (see
above)
common.groupByRange - remove check for isPieChart - use NVD3 handler instead
common.rekeySeries - return values array as array [output]

2016-08-31 ** 0.4.x
* Update data handling
** DATA TABLE COMPONENT**
*    Rename Table component to DataTable to avoid namespace collisions
*    Add hideFilterHeader and hideControls props to component
