Data Handling
=============
React-dash can be instantiated without any data processing, simply by passing data as an object, in the specified format (see format, below). In this way, you can implment the react-dash as a view-layer of an application, or as a client to a service that provides data in the specified formats. The dashboard currently provides a basic framework for fetching and processing data.
