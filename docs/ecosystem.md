# Ecosystem
React-dash is an npm library that serves as a toolkit for doing rapid prototyping and development. 

In order to further speed development, we also provide a [boilerplate module](https://github.com/NuCivic/react-dash-boilerplate) with which to build standalone projects.

For Drupal and DKAN development, we provide a [Drupal Module](https://github.com/NuCivic/react_dashboard) which allows you to easily embed a compiled dashboard into a drupal page, provides menu callbacks, and other useful features.
