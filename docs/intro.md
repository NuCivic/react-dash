# Getting Started

## Starting a project with the boilerplate module
The *react-dash-boilerplate* project provides a starter project and a development environment for doing react-dash development. It's a good place to start.

* Make sure that you have npm installed on your system
* Install the react-dashboard-boilerplate project and its dependencies:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/NuCivic/react-dashboard-boilerplate.git
  cd react-dashboard-boilerplate
  npm install
  npm run init
  npm run start
  ```
* Visit htpp://localhost:5000 on your system - if everything was successful, you should see an example dashboard
* Look at our [Developer's Guide](/development/index.html) for next steps to customize your dash!

## Copy the example project from the react-dash repo
If you can't get the boilerplate project to install, just download the react-dash project and use the example project as a starting place.

* Make sure that you have npm installed on your system
* Clone the react-dash repository
```
git clone https://github.com/NuCivic/react-dashboard.git
```
* Install dependencies and start the development server
```
npm install
npm run start
```
* Look in the `examples/` folder for the project source
* Take a look at our [Developer's Guide](development/index.html) for next steps to customize your dash!
